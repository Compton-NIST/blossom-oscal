# System Requirements for BloSS@M

## Mission

NIST ITL CSD [Secure Systems and Applications (SSA) Group](https://csrc.nist.gov/Groups/Computer-Security-Division/Secure-Systems-and-Applications)â€™s security research focuses on identifying emerging and high-priority technologies, and on developing security solutions that will have a high impact on the U.S. critical information infrastructure. The group conducts novel research and develops cutting-edge technology on behalf of government and industry, aiming to demonstrate, through proofs-of-concept, reference and prototype implementations, and demonstrations, secure, best practices starting with the earliest stages of technology development. SSA works to transfer new technologies to industry, produce new standards and guidance for federal agencies and industry, and develop tests, test methodologies, and assurance methods.

As part of this mission, the SSA Group is evaluating a next-generation approach to software asset management as an alternative to [the GSA Software License Management Service (SLMS)](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/Software%20License%20Management%20Service.pdf).

## Business Functions

The business unit that will design, implement, and operate this next-generation software asset management solution will emulate that of the GSA OCIO's SLMS business unit. These four business functions are centered on four key objectives, known as "The Four C's":

1. **Customization** for software asset management needs of different organizations
1. **Cutting costs** for the acquisition and maintenance of software
1. **Complying** with the relevant mandates for that software
1. Enhancing **Cybersecurity** posture around the use of said software

To that end, the solution developed and operated by the BloSS@M Team will, in a production scenario, realize the following business functions.

1. Usage analysis for software in a given agency
1. License optimization for proprietary licensed software
1. Maintenance analysis for that software
1. Cyber-threat detection
1. Audit prevention for software license usage
1. Standardized data collection and reporting on the above

## Business Processes

The BloSS@M Team, in a production scenario, would realize and augment business processes similar to that of the GSA OCIO SLMS Team. In particular, the development and operation focuses on the first three business functions exclusively: Program Management Activities, Inventory Collection, and Contracts (particularly around audit defense and compliance). These business processes are itemized below, grouped by category.

- Program Management Activities
  - Phase 1 Gap Analysis
  - Phase 2 Customized Engagement with Agency Customers
  - Phase 3 Asset Management Toolset and IT Assessment Program Management
- Inventory Collection
  - Baseline Inventory Analysis
  - Toolset Evaluation
  - Analysis of Alternative Software Solutions
- Contracts
  - Audit Defense and Compliance
  - Audit Resolution
  - ELA Review
  - T&C Development
  - Pricing analysis
- Vendor Negotiation
  - Market Analysis

  - Cloud Roadmap Development
  - Data Center Consolidation Advisory Services
  - Vendor Management Strategy
- IT Acquisition
  - EBC Development
  - MGT Act Budgets Requests
  - Development of Acquisition Package Components
  - Spend Analysis, Strategic Sourcing, Supplier Management, Procurement and Financial Management

## Information System Stakeholders

The stakeholders that will interact with this BLOSSOM system are:

1. Acquisition officers of customer agencies
1. Commercial software vendors selling software to customer agencies
1. Business owners for customer agencies' IT asset management function
1. Agency information security officials and mission-specific security officials for the asset management function in custom agencies
1. Chief Information Officers of customer agencies
1. BloSS@M development, operations, and cybersecurity staff that will operate this environment in a production scenario

NOTE: Although not all these stakeholders represent active users of the system, they are part of the application, design, implementation, and maintenance lifecycle of the the system.

## Information System Assets

The BloSS@M Team has outlined the following as key information assets for the system.

1. Authentication and authorization principles for system users
1. Software licenses
1. Software usage and license metadata
1. Authority-to-Operate (ATO) metadata (e.g. ATO status, date of ATO approval, date of ATO expiration)
1. Supply-chain risk scores for one or more software packages

Detailed analysis of sub-assets as implemented can be reviewed by looking at [the project's actively maintained threat model](../threat_model/index.md).

## Information System Types

Below are [the 800-60 Volume 2 Revision 1 information types](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-60v2r1.pdf) selected for this information system.

The provisional FIPS-199 impact levels for confidentiality, integrity, and impact levels are Moderate, Moderate, and Moderate, respectively.

The overall provisional impact level and security categorization are FIPS-199 Moderate.

    - [ ] C.2.7.2: Legislation testimony
    - [ ] C.2.7.3: Proposal development
    - [ ] C.2.7.4: Congressional liaison operations
  - C.2.8: General government: General Government involves the overhead costs of the Federal Government, including legislative and executive activities; provision of central fiscal, personnel, and property activities; and the provision of services that cannot reasonably be classified in any other service support area. As a normal rule, all activities reasonably or closely associated with other service support areas or information types shall be included in those service support areas or information types rather than listed as a part of general government. This service support area is reserved for central government management operations; most service delivery (mission-based) management activities would not be included here. Unlike the other service support functions, some general government information types are associated with specific organizations (e.g., Department of the Treasury, Executive Office of the President, Internal Revenue Service).
    - [ ] C.2.8.1: Central fiscal operations
    - [ ] C.2.8.2: Legislative functions
    - [ ] C.2.8.3: Executive functions
    - [ ] C.2.8.4: Central property management

    - [ ] C.2.8.12: General information
- C.3: Government resource management: Resource management functions are the back office support activities that enable the government to operate effectively. Security objectives and impacts for resource management functions are determined by the direct service missions and constituencies ultimately being supported. It is likely that all Federal government information systems store, process, and operate under the control of IT infrastructure maintenance information (e.g., password files and file and network access settings). A basic set of security controls will apply to this information and processes to combat potential corruption, misuse, or abuse of system information and processes.
  - [ ] C.3.1: Administrative management: Administrative Management involves the day-to-day management and maintenance of the internal infrastructure. Administrative information is usually routine and is relatively low impact. However, some administrative management information is either very sensitive (e.g., logistics management for nuclear or other hazardous materials, security management information, and security clearance management information) or critical (e.g., inventory control and logistics management information needed to support time-critical operations). National security information is outside the scope of this guideline. [See Appendix A, Glossary of Terms, for a definition of national security information/systems.] Routine administrative management information systems that do not process classified information are not usually designated national security systems, even if they are critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions.
    - [ ] C.3.1.1: Facilities, fleet, and equipment management
    - [ ] C.3.1.2: Help desk services
    - [ ] C.3.1.3: Security management
    - [ ] C.3.1.4: Travel
    - [ ] C.3.1.5: Workplace policy development and management
  - [ ] C.3.2: Financial management: Financial management involves the aggregate set of accounting practices and procedures that allow for the accurate and effective handling of all government revenues, funding, and expenditures. Confidentiality impacts associated with financial management information are generally associated with the sensitivity of the existence of specific projects, programs, and/or technologies that might be revealed by unauthorized disclosure of information. For integrity, temporary successful frauds can affect agency image, and corrective actions are often disruptive to agency operations. Permanent loss/unavailability of financial management information can cripple agency operations.
    - [ ] C.3.2.1: Assets and liability management
    - [ ] C.3.2.2: Reporting and information
    - [ ] C.3.2.3: Funds control
    - [ ] C.3.2.4: Accounting
    - [ ] C.3.2.5: Payments
    - [ ] C.3.2.6: Collections and receivables
    - [ ] C.3.2.7: Cost accounting / performance measurement
  - [ ] C.3.3: Human resource management: Human resource management activities involve all activities associated with the recruitment and management of personnel.
  - [ ] C.3.3.1: HR strategy
    - [ ] C.3.3.2: Staff acquisition
    - [ ] C.3.3.3: Organization and position management
    - [ ] C.3.3.4: Compensation management
    - [ ] C.3.3.5: Benefits management
    - [ ] C.3.3.6: Employee performance management
    - [ ] C.3.3.7: Employee relations
    - [ ] C.3.3.8: Labor relations
    - [ ] C.3.3.9: Separation management
    - [ ] C.3.3.10: Human resources development
  - C.3.4: Supply chain management: Supply chain management involves the purchasing, tracking, and overall management of goods and services.
    - [ ] C.3.4.1: Goods acquisition
    - C.3.4.2: Inventory control
    - C.3.4.3: Logistics management
    - C.3.4.4: Services acquisition
  - [ ] C.3.5: Information and technology management: IT management involves the coordination of IT resources and systems required to support or enable a citizen service. Impacts to information associated with the operation of IT systems generally need to be considered even when all mission-related information processed by the system is intended to be available to the general public. The relevant issues may be different for integrity and availability than for confidentiality. Information that has been made public, by definition, requires no confidentiality protection. In contrast, integrity and availability protection cannot be maintained for copies of information that have been distributed to the public. Integrity and availability assurance can only be maintained by maintaining copies of information in organization-controlled information systems.
    - [ ] C.3.5.1: System development
    - C.3.5.2: Lifecycle / change management
    - [ ] C.3.5.3: System maintenance
    - [ ] C.3.5.4: IT infrastructure maintenance
    - C.3.5.5: Information security
    - C.3.5.6: Record retention
    - C.3.5.7: Information management
    - [ ] C.3.5.8: System and network monitoring
    - C.3.5.9: Information sharing
- [ ] D: Mission-based: In general, individual agencies should identify the mission information types processed by their systems. This Appendix identifies some information types that might be processed by Federal government organizations. The material includes mission information and potential impacts of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or unavailability of mission information. The primary purpose for Federal government information systems is to support provision of basic services to U.S. citizens and residents. This section addresses information types associated with both services provided by the Federal government to citizens and mechanisms used to achieve the purposes of government or deliver services for citizens. Delivery mechanisms include financial vehicles, direct government delivery, and indirect government delivery. Federal government missions or delivery mechanisms distributed among 26 mission areas and modes of delivery are identified in Table D-1. Each mission area and delivery mode corresponds to a Services to Citizens or Mode of Delivery business area as defined in the BRM described in the FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document Version 2.3. There is not a one- to-one mapping of services and delivery modes to government departments and agencies. Some departments and agencies focus on a single mission. Others support multiple missions within a mission area. Still others provide services associated with several different mission areas. An information type is associated with each Federal government mission and delivery mode. The identity of each information type is defined by the mission with which it is associated. Some of the management and support functions executed to support delivery of services or manage government resources are also executed by some agencies in delivering services to citizens. (See especially the 'General Government' functions in Section C.2.8. of Appendix C) Most of these information types could be included in Appendix D as mission-based information types. Because the BRM categorizes them as services delivery support functions, they are included in Volume I, Section 4.1.2 and Appendix C and are not repeated in Appendix D. The common impact determination factors described in Volume I, Section 4.2.3 and 4.4, also apply to mission-based information.
  - [ ] D.1: Defense and national security: Defense and national security operations protect and advance U.S. National Security interests and, if deterrence fails, decisively defeat threats to those interests. Defense and national security activities include military operations, border protection, and intelligence gathering. Defense operations are subdivided into the following sub-elements: Impacts to information and many information systems associated with defense and national security missions may affect the security of a broad range of critical infrastructures and key national assets. Systems that, involve command and control of military forces, weapons control29, involve equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system, are critical to the direct fulfillment of military missions or are otherwise employed in strictly military operations30 are defined under Public Law as national security systems. National security information and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline. Information assurance responsibilities are delegated to the Department of Defense for systems that are operated by the Department of Defense, or another entity on behalf of the Department of Defense31. Security objectives and impact levels associated with these systems are determined by the Department of Defense.

## Security and Privacy Requirements

The BloSS@M Team relies on guidance from the Risk Management Framework, [NIST IR-8011 series](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8011/vol-1/final), and [our threat model](../threat_model/index.md) to define and prioritize system security and privacy requirements.

Below are the initial requirements for this pilot. Per NIST IR-8011, these requirements are categorized within [the framework of the DHS CISA Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Capabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/cdm). These are for initial system design and early implementation, so they may not be authoritative for the whole lifecycle of the project. The authoritative point of reference for planned, ongoing, and completed work for these requirements is the [the project GitHub board](https://github.com/usnistgov/blossom). Requirements we document here at this time may cross-reference initial requirements design and implementation linked to issues in the board.

### Hardware Asset Management Capability (HWAW)

**NOTE**: The BloSS@M pilot is intended for design, implementation, and deployment only in a cloud-native environment. This choice means we do not directly control hardware. Some capabilities and sub-capabilities will be dependent upon our cloud service provider and will be accordingly design, implemented, and documented in components and system security plan. Others are still relevant for the management of "hardware-like" assets in our cloud environment(s).

- HWAM-C00: Prevent unauthorized devices
- HWAM-C01: Reduce number of devices without assigned device manager
- HWAM-C02: Reduce exploitation of decommissioned or deprovisioned systems
